Creating a basic stopwatch app involves building an interface that allows users to start, pause, and reset a timer, displaying minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
It typically includes a user interface with a display for the elapsed time and controls for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer. 
The HTML structure provides the basic layout of the stopwatch, including the display area and control buttons.
CSS is used to style the stopwatch to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
JavaScript is used to implement the core functionality of the stopwatch, such as starting, pausing, and resetting the timer.
